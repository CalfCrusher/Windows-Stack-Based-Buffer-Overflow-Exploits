 Easy RM to MP3 Converter 2.7.3 local buffer overflow vulnerability loading malicious playlist (EDB-ID: 10374 https://easy-rm-to-mp3-converter.en.softonic.com/)

1) check at exact bytes when the program crash during the loading of malicious playlist:
	check fuzzer.py
2) we have 30000 char. Let's create a pattern with ruby msf tool:
	ruby pattern_create.rb 30000
3) we insert this pattern in new fuzzer:
	check fuzzer2.py
4) we generate another malicious .m3u and load again in application while immunity debugger is running or attached

5) the application crash again, check EIP Address (346C4833) to calculate the precise offset then:
	ruby pattern_offset.rb -q 346C4833 -l 30000
	please note that you need to specify the length also

6) Check note of Exact match at offset 26081

7) we generate another malicious .m3u using another fuzzer:
	check fuzzer3.py

8) note that now the program at EIP register contain address 42424242 that's our B char.

9) Now we need a suitable JMP address
	!mona modules (we choose kernel32.dll as usual but we can search for any module with ASLR disable not always will works)
	!mona find -s '\xff\xe4' -m kernel32.dll (address 775FF7F7. that's our JMP Address)
10) Now we can create a final exploit inserting a generic shellcode like notepad.exe
	check exploit.py and run it
